## Tech Stack

**Client:** Python, Command Line Interface

**Server:** MongoDB

## Installation

Install SecureO with pip

```bash
  pip install SecureO
  pm
```

After installing, SecureO provides a pm command for accessing the password manager via the command line. However, if pm does not work immediately, it may be because the Python Scripts directory is not in your system PATH.

#### Follow the steps below to add the Scripts folder to your PATH.

    Step 1 - Locate the Scripts Folder: C:\Users\<YourUsername>\AppData\Local\Programs\Python\Python<YourPythonVersion>\Scripts\
    Step 2 - Add to PATH:
      1. Go to System Properties > Advanced > Environment Variables.
      2. Under System Variables, find the Path variable and click Edit.
      3. Add the path to your Scripts folder from step 1.
